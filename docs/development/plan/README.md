# Plan

Only the unfinished work. A finished task is deleted from this folder in the commit that finishes it; a
finished phase moves to `archive/`. Phase and task numbers live only here. The code rules apply to every
task: a task report states *size gate passed, no new lint suppression, coverage not lower*.

## Status (2026-10-26)

- **The work is the v0.2 rework**: [v0.2-rework.md](v0.2-rework.md) holds the decisions agreed with the owner
  and the order of work. **R1 to R5 are done**: [software-design/](../../software-design/README.md)
  describes v0.2; the project has no Python; the label fixtures are written by `crates/fixtures` one
  character per text object, as the downloads are; today's reading of the owner's eleven sample files is
  pinned in `work/baseline/` on this PC ([testing.md](../testing.md), *Local baseline*); `crates/store`
  holds the journal, the lock, the inputs, the views, the open-time checks and the namespaces; and
  `packing-engine` holds the v0.2 chain — `packing-workflows.toml`, copies with the courier clue,
  repeats and the copies left out, the plan with order contents, the `batch_saved` record — and the 2.32
  fix; `crates/verify` checks a batch's outputs by page digest with `lopdf` alone (every page of the
  samples that PDFium copies keeps its digest). **R6 is under way** ([R6-app-journal.md](R6-app-journal.md)):
  R6.1 to R6.3 are done, R6.4 is next. **The program the owner runs is v0.2.0**: it saves through
  `crates/batch` and the journal into `{data_dir}/{namespace}/{date}/` and writes the summary PDF; *Categories*
  and *Search* are gone until R8 and R7 bring them back on v0.2, so until then the sort rules are edited
  in `packing-workflows.toml` by hand, and every repeat keeps its first copy. A task gets its own file in
  this folder when it starts; until then its row in the order of work is the task.
- **The owner checked the v0.1 program** (2026-10-26): it works as before, including the full product name
  read without a space inside a word; the owner said to go ahead with R6. R6 is the first task that changes
  the program the owner runs: the app saves through the journal into `{data_dir}/{namespace}/{date}/` and no
  longer shows the v0.1 data (`labels\`, `state.json`), which stays on disk unread
  ([D-APP-17](../../software-design/decisions/app-features.md)).
- **Not blocked on the owner otherwise.** The owner may read the design at any time, starting with
  [the workflow](../../software-design/workflow/README.md) (each step against one page) and the points below;
  a finding goes into [reviews/app.md](../../reviews/app.md) under R-APP-2 and changes the design before the
  task that builds it.
- **The owner confirmed** (2026-10-25) the points R1 had to settle: the ship-by deadline is a date only
  (D-APP-21); orders are grouped by name, variation and quantity, the Seller SKU kept only for reference —
  names and SKUs can change during the day, and the order inside a group matters less than the grouping
  (D-APP-20); a `courier` filter compares the code; an amend uses the rule of the batch's name, else its
  snapshot (D-RULES-2); a continuation page must follow its label page (D-LABEL-12).
- **The owner chose *order content*** (2026-10-25) for the orders with the same items inside a group PDF
  ([D-LABEL-15](../../software-design/decisions/label.md)): the Seller SKU and the printed `Qty Total` moved
  from the content to the order, and the block number (`2-A-05`) is gone. The owner judges on the running
  screens (R8) whether the word fits; a finding goes into [reviews/ui.md](../../reviews/ui.md).
- **Kept for the rework**: [workflow-audit.md](workflow-audit.md), where the built program differs from the
  design; the v0.2 crates close its rows, and the program follows when R5 and R6 put them to use.
- The program folder `target/portable/Packing/` is rebuilt after each task; a rebuild replaces only
  `Packing.exe` and `pdfium.dll`, so the owner's settings, rules and data there stay. Its regression list, in [the phase 2 plan](../../archive/handoff-2026-10-23.md), is where R8's checklist
  starts.

## Where to work

A **local** session on the owner's PC (Windows, Git Bash): it builds, runs `tools/make-portable.sh` and
commits. A cloud session cannot run commands on the PC; it can only read and write files there.

Outside Windows the packing-list tests fail, because the packing list loads its fonts from
`C:\Windows\Fonts` (ten tests of `packing-app`); that is not a regression.

## Reading for a new session

In this order.

1. [../../../AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) and [../README.md](../README.md): rules, commit and push, layout.
2. [v0.2-rework.md](v0.2-rework.md), then the task's own file when it has one.
3. [../../software-design/workflow/README.md](../../software-design/workflow/README.md) (the steps, the
   invariants I1–I12 and the verification matrix), then [data/](../../software-design/data/README.md) and the
   design files the task names.
4. [../code-rules.md](../code-rules.md) and [../testing.md](../testing.md).
5. [../../business-process/02-data-sources.md](../../business-process/02-data-sources.md) before touching
   any PDF code.
6. Code, after the documents: `crates/` and `app/`; then `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`.

`samples/` and `work/` are confidential: never commit them or copy real data from them.
