# 02 — Design Questions

Questions that need the owner's choice. Each explains the problem, gives options with an
example of what you would see, and marks one **Built for now**: what the code does until the
owner decides (so development is not blocked). Add new ones as the next free `D` number; remove
one once its answer is written into the other documents.

Owner decisions that change the design but are not designed yet are listed under **Decided**,
below, until a later pass writes them into the other documents.

## Decided (not yet designed)

These concern the Android app; they are designed in the app revision ([D1](#d1--the-android-app-and-the-pick-flow)).

- **The Android app does no PDF work.** Reading, sorting and grouping the label PDFs, and
  printing the packing list, stay on the PC. The app never opens the label PDFs.
- **The Android workflow does not follow the PC workflow.** The app is its own checking
  workflow, not a mirror of the picks. The app design in
  [01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) (A-sections),
  [05-app-architecture.md](05-app-architecture.md) and [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md) is the old
  one and is revised later.
- **Scan and the filter (Android).** When the item scanned is not the filtered one, warn that it
  does not match **and** offer to change the filter so it matches the package scanned: filter on
  the product only, or on product **and** quantity. (Changes
  [01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) A2 and the filter-rejected message in
  [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md#scan-messages).)

## D1 — The Android app and the pick flow

The PC side now works with picks ([07-pc-app.md](07-pc-app.md)); the app design is still the
old one: batches from the orders CSV, pack groups, group numbers and scan filters on
batch/group ([01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) A-sections,
[05-app-architecture.md](05-app-architecture.md), [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md)). Before phase 3
the app is revised as its own checking workflow — not the pick flow, and with no PDF work (see
**Decided**). Open until then.
