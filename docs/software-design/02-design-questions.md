# 02 — Design Questions

Questions that need the owner's choice. Each explains the problem, gives options with an
example of what you would see, and marks one **Built for now**: what the code does until the
owner decides (so development is not blocked). Add new ones as the next free `D` number; remove
one once its answer is written into the other documents.

Owner decisions that change the design but are not designed yet are listed under **Decided**,
below, until a later pass writes them into the other documents.

## Decided (not yet designed)

These concern the Android app; they are designed in the app revision ([D1](#d1--the-android-app-and-the-pick-flow)).

- **The Android app does no PDF work.** Reading, sorting and grouping the label PDFs, and
  printing the packing list, stay on the PC. The app never opens the label PDFs.
- **The Android workflow does not follow the PC workflow.** The app is its own checking
  workflow, not a mirror of the picks. The app design in
  [01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) (A-sections),
  [05-app-architecture.md](05-app-architecture.md) and [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md) is the old
  one and is revised later.
- **Scan and the filter (Android).** When the item scanned is not the filtered one, warn that it
  does not match **and** offer to change the filter so it matches the package scanned: filter on
  the product only, or on product **and** quantity. (Changes
  [01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) A2 and the filter-rejected message in
  [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md#scan-messages).)

## D1 — The Android app and the pick flow

The PC side now works with picks ([07-pc-app.md](07-pc-app.md)); the app design is still the
old one: batches from the orders CSV, pack groups, group numbers and scan filters on
batch/group ([01-requirements.md](01-requirements.md) A-sections,
[05-app-architecture.md](05-app-architecture.md), [06-app-ui.md](06-app-ui.md)). Before phase 3
the app is revised as its own checking workflow — not the pick flow, and with no PDF work (see
**Decided**). Open until then.

## D13 — Unticking the rest row

**Words.** The *rest row* is the last row of the Plan screen ([08 › 3. Plan](08-pc-app-ui.md#3-plan)):
the last `categories.toml` entry when it has no condition (e.g. *Z Lainnya*), else
`? Uncategorised`. Unticking **Use** on a row skips that pick for this batch: its orders fall to
the rows below. The rest row has no row below it.

**Example.** Batch 3 has 256 orders: 130 Sepatu, 20 Spion & Knalpot, 106 for *Z Lainnya*. You
untick *Z Lainnya*.

| Option | What you see |
|---|---|
| **1. The 106 orders go to `? Uncategorised`** (**Built for now**) | A new last row `? Uncategorised` with 106 orders; the batch still saves all 256 orders |
| 2. The rest row has no tick | *Z Lainnya* is always used; to leave orders out, change the conditions |
| 3. The 106 orders are left out of this batch | They are not saved; they count as "not saved today" and come back in the next batch with the same labels |

**What the answer changes:** the plan count in `plan.rs` and the Plan screen (task 2.10).

## D14 — A log file

**Words.** [08 › 6. Settings](08-pc-app-ui.md#6-settings) has an *About* row with
**Open log file**. A log file would be a text file in the data folder where the app writes
what it did and any unexpected error (e.g. `log.txt`: "07:40:12 batch 1 saved, 3 files, 600
orders"). Nothing else in the design writes one; every batch already has its `summary.txt`.

| Option | What you see |
|---|---|
| **1. No log file** (**Built for now**) | *About* shows the version and the PDFium version only; errors are shown on screen |
| 2. `log.txt` in the data folder | One line per batch saved, reverted or amended, plus unexpected errors; **Open log file** opens it |

**What the answer changes:** the *About* row of Settings and one small writer in the app.
